# PrintOut
Printout is a simple C++ command-line utility inspired by the Unix cat tool. It reads a text file and prints its contents to standard output, with optional flags to extend the behavior.

# Current features:

Print file contents line by line

-c : display the total number of lines at the end

-w : display the total number of words at the end

The project is intentionally minimal and educational â€” a way to practice C++ basics, command-line argument parsing, and incremental design (procedural vs. object-oriented).

# Planned improvements:

Additional flags (line numbering, squeeze blank lines, etc.)

Better error handling and multiple file support
